You must have Chrome installed and run Chromedriver before starting the simulation.  

Ensure Chromedriver is running on the correct port as defined in `main.rs`. 
Use the following command in CMD: ``.\chromedriver --port=9515``  

Update the `.env` file to match your application's environment. The default login URL is set to `http://localhost:54878/`, with empty passwords. These must be updated to valid credentials.
